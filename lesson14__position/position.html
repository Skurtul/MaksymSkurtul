            <p class="description">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
                of your UI using React components: <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code</em>. You can learn more
                about
                React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

            <p class="description">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <p class="description"> <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction
                to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to
                work in.
            </p>
            <p class="description"><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
                lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <mark class="mark">
                    [Text]Hello, I am your cat![/Text].</mark>
            </p>
            <p class="description">The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even
                more.
                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                <mark class="mark">name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                <mark class="mark">[Text]</mark>
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong> + props.</strong>
                Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal
                data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                interaction.
                State gives your components memory!

                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText 
                </em>prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing 
                prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into 
                a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. 
                So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
